- `HR project.pbix`: The Power BI file with the HR dashboard.

## Tools Used

- Power Query Editor (for data transformation)
- Power BI (for data visualization)

## Key Insights
- Analyzed attendance trends across three months.
- Identified patterns in work-from-home, sick leave, and overall attendance.
- Created visualizations to track attendance percentages, sick leave reasons, and work preferences.
